# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1:  December 27, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Python/Pandas warm-up. Created a class for fake data generator. I'll use it next days to do some analysis.

**Thoughts:** Easy warm-up, just to clear some dust from my Pandas skills.

### Day 2:  December 28, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Started Javascript warm-up. Finished iPad setup (see [here](links.md)), first version of [snippets](snippets.md).

**Thoughts:** I totally agree with me :-) Starting warming up some know language with simple problems and trying to summarize some topic skill into [snippets](snippets.md) is a good startin point.

### Day 3:  December 29, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Continued Javascript warm-up. [snippets](snippets.md) updated.

**Thoughts:** Good, ready to start some simple project. Maybe check some algorithm before.

**Link to work:** [snippets](snippets.md)

### Day 4:  December 30, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Started working on [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) following the official [tutorial](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/tutorial/). Integrated a simple "hello world" app with [Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa), the incredible tool for easy deployment on AWS.

**Thoughts:** Good starting point for further projects. Now I can easly deploy a backend. Maybe tomorrow I'll document it on a blog post.

### Day 5:  December 31, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Moving on with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). Started using Templates and Web Forms.

**Thoughts:** Interesting. I had no time to write the promised post :-(

### Day 6:  January 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress:** Started working with Python Pandas for a work project. Wrote basic function to create fake Dataframes to analyze in the next days.

**Thoughts:** Till now I'm working on technolgies I already know just to refine my know how. I'm considering starting a project from scratch with a technology I don't already know.

### Day 7:  January 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress:** Great progress with my Python classes to create fake work dataframes. Today I started analyzing them and I feel great.

**Thoughts:** Still need a couple of days to finish my analytic class, then I'll start the real project. Feeling better every day.

### Day 8:  January 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress:** Startet the new project in JS/JQ. Done part of the basic structure, I'll publish it as soon as it will be completed (a few days).

**Thoughts:** It's easy for me to write JS/JQ, good progresses for today.

### Day 11:  January 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress:** Today I continued moving on with JS. I started [this](https://www.udemy.com/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/learn/v4/overview) fantastic course to review my algorithmic skills with javascript.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I'll try to do some coding with my iPad. The setup seems fantastic.

### Day 12:  January 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress:** Still working on [this](https://www.udemy.com/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/learn/v4/overview) course. 

**Thoughts:** I stuck a couple of minutes on a stupid point due to a lack of proof reading the question. TL;DR: Always read EVERY word of the question.
