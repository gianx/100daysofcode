# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0:  December 27, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Python/Pandas warm-up. Created a class for fake data generator. I'll use it next days to do some analysis.

**Thoughts:** Easy warm-up, just to clear some dust from my Pandas skills.

**Link to work:** n/a 

### Day 1:  December 28, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started Javascript warm-up. Finished iPad setup (see [here](links.md)), first version of [snippets](snippets.md).

**Thoughts:** I totally agree with me :-) Starting warming up some know language with simple problems and trying to summarize some topic skill into [snippets](snippets.md) is a good startin point.

### Day 2:  December 29, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Continued Javascript warm-up. [snippets](snippets.md) updated.

**Thoughts:** Good, ready to start some simple project. Maybe check some algorithm before.
